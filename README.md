# Greedy Navigation
Collapse a menu that is overly long into a drop down menu when menu extends past screen width.

The menu items will slow collapse into the dropdown menu as each individual menu item no longer fits with in the screen dimensions.

Adjustments have to be made to HTML, CSS, Javascript to adjust for individual site this will be used on.
